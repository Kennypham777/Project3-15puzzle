            <h2>Role and Time Spend</h2>
            <p>I did the 4x4 grid layout css and the shuffling logic of the tiles (3 hours). 
                The shuffle logic also required me to make logic that detects adjacent tiles to the empty space and to make sure the shuffle is solvable (3 hours). 
                I'm also the one that set up the fifteen.html layout and its corresponding css (1 hour).</p>

                I also addded background music to the game. 
                I added a timer and move counting feature, as well as a display option for the best time and moves. </h2>
