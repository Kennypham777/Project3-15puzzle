            <p>I did the 4x4 grid layout css and the shuffling logic of the tiles (3 hours). The shuffle logic also required me to make logic that detects adjacent tiles to the empty space (2 hours). 
                I'm also the one that set up the fifteen.html layout and its corresponding css (1 hour).</p>
